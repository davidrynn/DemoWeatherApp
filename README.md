# DemoWeatherApp

* Within the time constraints, Demo weather app with the following requirements:
* Allow users to input a city and based on city, get weather data
* Auto-load last city searched for on launch unless..
* Ask user for location access and use location as initial search instead of last city.

Could use - More testing, better caching, better UI.
Uses MVVM with services due to simplicity of exercise and needs.
Uses SwiftUI built on UIKit in order to demonstrate usage of the two together.
